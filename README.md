- 👋 Hi, I’m @birdog411 (Nik)
- 👀 I’m interested in databases and websites, SDR and AI for image recognition. I have worked in C# in the past to create my own Jarvis/Alexa which worked fairly well.
- I have also worked with Arduino`s for home automation and for work with NMEA generators.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python and still a beginner, completed various courses on youtube, quite recenetly I wrote a small code and it worked first time.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing at the moment, I`m certain I would hold up any work you might have.
- 📫 How to reach me
